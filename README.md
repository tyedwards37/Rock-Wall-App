## Design Heuristics / iOS Human Guidelines

### Design Heuristics:
- **User Control and Freedom** (User always has a back button or redo option. Nothing is set in stone in case the user makes a mistake)
- **Aesthetic and Minamalist Design** (Design is simple and not cluttered)
### iOS Human Guidelines
- **Entering Data**
  - *Be clear about the data you need* (The user always know what data is being asked of them, and they have the freedom to enter it whenever they want to)
- **Feedback**
  - *Make sure all feedback is accessible* (Whether the user has volume off, or they look away from the screen, feedback will still be there to ensure the user is still in the loop of information)
- **Accessibility**
  - *Simplicity* (Familiar wording, no jargain is used. Anyone will be able to pick up the app and understand)
- **Tab Views**
  - *Avoid providing more than six tabs in a tab view* (We give the user only **3** options)
